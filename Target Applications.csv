Policies are intended to be long-term and guide the development of more specific rules to address specific situations. Policies are interpreted and supported by standards, baselines and procedures. Policies should be relatively few in number, must be approved and supported by executive-level management, and must provide overall direction to the organization. For ease of communication to employees of the firm, a three-level policy structure has been designed. The intent of this structure is to allow employees to quickly locate policies based on a high-level name, an area of focus or a specific section. A Policy name is the highest-level item in the Policy Framework. Policy names include high-level statements of management expectations regarding a security issue (e.g., 8.0 Access Control).","Policy","True","0","False","@{CreateDate=2006-01-19T03:31:47.873; UpdateDate=2021-10-29T11:30:03.823; CreateLogin=2; UpdateLogin=2}"
